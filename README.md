# Abstract of Article

This work introduces the framework of polynomial optimization theory to solve fractional polynomial programs (FPP) and shows how it can be applied to energy-efficiency maximization in communications. Unlike other widely used optimization frameworks, the proposed one applies to a larger class of FPP, not necessarily defined by an objective given by the ratio of concave and convex functions. In particular, we provide an iterative algorithm that is provably convergent and enjoys asymptotic optimality properties. Numerical results are used to validate its accuracy in the non-asymptotic regime. To this end, we consider a cellular network and maximize the energy efficiency with respect to the number of antennas and user equipments.

# Content of Code Package

The article contains 2 simulation figures, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 as they appear in the article. These are generated by the Matlab scripts Fig1main.m and Fig2main.m, respectively. The package contains two additional Matlab scripts (that contain the system model parameters) and one function (auxiliary  to Fig. 2) which are called by the main scripts: Fig1main.m and Fig2main.m.
